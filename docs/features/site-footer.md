# SharePoint Site Footer

Footers are a common branding / navigation control in websites and portals. SharePoint Communication sites will have an out-of-the box footer control, which can be controlled either using UI elements or by using APIs. This control supports following elements

- 8 links or labels
- Footer logo and footer name
